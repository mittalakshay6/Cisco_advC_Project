Below are the system requirements for compiling and executing the program.

a. A 32 BIT linux box with >= 1 GB memory
b. The system should have GCC and standard C libraries installed

1. To compile the program, use command 'make all' which should generate the required executable binaries driver, genb (to generate birds.bin), geno (to generate observations.bin)
2. After the binaries are compiled, execute the binaries by staying in the same directory as the binaries. The order of execution is as follows.

a. Execute genb binary first to generate birds.bin file.
b. Execute geno binary to generate observations.bin file.
c. Finally, execute driver binary to execute the program.

Note: The binaries discussed above (birds.bin and observations.bin) should reside in the same directory as of the driver.
